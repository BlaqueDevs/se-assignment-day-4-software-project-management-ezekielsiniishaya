1. Timely delivery is crucial because it ensures the project stays on schedule, meets stakeholder expectations, and avoids cost overruns. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by setting realistic timelines, breaking down tasks, monitoring progress, and adjusting resources as needed.

2. Effective cost control prevents financial waste and ensures that the project remains within budget. Strategies include careful budget planning, regular financial monitoring, and managing scope changes to prevent unnecessary costs.

3. Agile is iterative, flexible, and allows for continuous feedback, while Waterfall is linear and follows a structured approach. Agile’s main advantage is adaptability to changing requirements, but it may lack clear documentation. Waterfall’s advantage is clarity in planning, but it struggles with changes once the project is in progress.

4. Agile is beneficial in projects where requirements are expected to evolve, like app development, while Waterfall works better for projects with clearly defined requirements, such as construction or infrastructure projects.

5. Methods include regular code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration. Quality assurance is important to prevent defects, reduce rework, and ensure the final product meets user expectations.

6. Defining the project scope helps set clear goals and boundaries, reducing the risk of scope creep. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of tasks, making complex projects more manageable and ensuring that all aspects of the project are addressed.

7. A detailed project schedule ensures tasks are completed on time and resources are allocated efficiently. Gantt charts assist by visually representing the project timeline, dependencies, and progress.

8. The core issues addressed by the software could include inefficiencies, user pain points, or gaps in the market. These problems are significant because they directly impact user satisfaction and productivity.

9. Clearly defining the problem helps target specific solutions, preventing wasted resources and ensuring the final product effectively meets user needs.

10. The software solution can be described as a user-friendly tool designed to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and enhance user experience.

11. Key features might include ease of use, scalability, customizability, or integration with other systems, making the software stand out in the market.

12. Data on market size and growth potential could include trends in user adoption, projected industry growth, and demand for similar solutions, indicating the software’s potential impact.

13. Understanding market trends helps in positioning the software to meet future demands, anticipate shifts in user behavior, and align development with market needs.
